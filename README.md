# demoexercise

Django project that allows the creation of mailing lists and creation of email campaigns

## possible improvements

- switch to `ViewSets` if current views are expanded
- more extensive Tests
- implement `mailing_campaign/mail.py` Classes as `Model`s and allow saving them to the database (only if needed)
